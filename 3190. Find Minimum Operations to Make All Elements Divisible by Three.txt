3190. Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three

class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums){//nums = [1,2,3,4]
        // remainder 0 - already divisible by 3, no operation needed
        // remainder 1 - decrease by 1 to make it divisible by 3
        // remainder 2 - increase by 1 to make it divisible by 3
        int res = 0;
        for(int num: nums){//num = [1,2,3,4]
            if(num%3 != 0)//res now holds the count of numbers in the nums array that are not divisible by 3.
                res++;
